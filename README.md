# Codewars Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) coding challenges.

## Structure

Solutions are organized by difficulty level (kyu):

```
├── 8kyu/          # Easiest challenges
├── 7kyu/
├── 6kyu/
├── 5kyu/
├── 4kyu/
├── 3kyu/
├── 2kyu/
└── 1kyu/          # Hardest challenges
```

## How to Use

Each solution is contained in its own directory within the appropriate kyu folder. The directory name typically matches the kata name.

### Solution Structure

Each kata solution typically includes:
- Solution file (e.g., `solution.py`, `solution.js`, etc.)
- Test file (if applicable)
- README with kata description and approach

## Contributing

This is a personal repository for tracking my Codewars progress. Feel free to use these solutions as references for learning purposes.

## Notes

- Solutions are my own work unless otherwise noted
- Some problems may have multiple solutions exploring different approaches
- Language choice varies based on the kata requirements or personal practice goals
